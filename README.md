# cihi-open-data-portal
COMP 3220 Project

The Canadian Institute of Health Information ( https://www.cihi.ca/en/access-data-and-reports ) has a nice way to organize and query data in a more visually pleasing interface and easier to find sets with some controls over privacy/usage. There are real laws preventing us from sharing data that contains any information that identifies users.

Developing the next-generation open data access portal in the form of a live dashboard and user interface, complete with the ability to collect (upload) data, manage it, distribute it in various formats, and deliver high-quality API libraries for developers.
